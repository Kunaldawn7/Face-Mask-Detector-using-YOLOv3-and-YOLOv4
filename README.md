# Face Mask Detector using YOLOv3 and YOLOv4
Here, we try to differntiate between persons wearing and not wearing face masks. For this, we train the YOLO darknet framework from AlexeyAB's github repository ( https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet ). We train the framework both for YOLOv3 and YOLOv4.

I have also linked to the weights files which I have trained been provided below:

The weights for YOLOv3 can be found here: ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uW8Vv9RXJ-UE4ZSgqtw96uqrnx7Rlov9/view?usp=sharing )

The weights for YOLOv4 can be found here: ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1l9YKmVXVCf02zg8NasUZ-aPrjcVOrr/view?usp=sharing )

The video files for inference can also be found here:
